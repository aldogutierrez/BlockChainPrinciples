# Block Chain Principles

Recently, I have heard the term "Blockchain" but only associated it with Bitcoin and
other cryptocurrencies, so I decided to dive in and know for myself what blockchain was all about.

It turns out that blockchain is a list of 'blocks' connected by hashes, sort of like a linked list.

This chain of interconnected blocks is then distributed across a P2P network for validation and transaction handling.
